As usual, this release contains a large number of fixes. Also, many new
coding examples are added. Compared to the previous version, the ATS
interface for libc functions is greatly extended, and there are now many
examples involving systems programming that are available in the following
directory:

$ATSHOME/doc/EXAMPLES/AUP/.

A (partial) list of the changes since the last release are given as
follows:

1. -D_ATS_TERMINATION_CHECK is changed to -D_ATS_PROOFCHECK; fixing a
   related bug in [d3explst_funarg_tr].

   (ats_trans4)
10. Fixing a bug involving mishandling negative long integers
11. Adding rarray (reversed array) implementation

0.2.1

<pre>
ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.1:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. Also, many
new coding examples are added.

1. The support for 'atsopt --depgen' is revamped.
2. The support for boolean patterns is made available.
3. Most string-generating functions now return linear strings
   (strptr). This is a change that can have pervasive impact.
4. Some support for GMP/MPQ and GMP/MPF functions are added. See
   libc/SATS/gmp.sat for details.
5. Overhauling the ATS building system.

The following packages are available in ATS/libats:

fmatrix.sats
freelst.sats
funralist_nested.sats
genarrays.sats
hashtable_chain.sats
hashtable_linprb.sats
intinf.sats
iterint.sats
linbitvec.sats (newly added)
linmap_avltree.sats
linqueue_arr.sats
linqueue_lst.sats
linstack_arr.sats
parworkshop.sats
regexp.sats

The following libraries are available in ATS/contrib:

glib
cairo
pango
X11
GTK
GL (OpenGL, GLU and GLUT)
SDL
cURL (only a few functions are available)
Clutter (this one is mostly for experiment)
cblas (joint work with Shivkumar Chandrasekaran)
clapack (joint work with Shivkumar Chandrasekaran)

0.2.0

<pre>
ats-lang-anairiats-0.2.0:

This is a milestone release. The original plan for OOP support in ATS has
been scratched completely, resulting in about 1500 lines of code being
removed. Instead, some support is added to interface ATS with external code
written in OOP-style.

The following libraries are now available for use:

contrib/glib
contrib/cairo
contrib/pango
contrib/X11
contrib/GTK
contrib/GL (OpenGL, GLU and GLUT)
contrib/SDL

Much more effort is needed to expand the APIs for these libraries. So far,
only the API for cairo is close to completion.
</pre>

######

0.1.9

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.9:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes. The most notable
addition is a package named 'parworkshop' in $ATSHOME/libats, which
provides some rudimentary support for multicore programming (SMP).
Please see $ATSHOME/doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE for some examples.

(*
// this feature is retracted as it is difficult to support
1. overloaded symbols in a macro definition is re-loaded when the macro
   definition is expanded. This change can greatly facilitate the use of
   macros defined in $ATSHOME/prelude/macrodef.sats

2. macro expansion is now handled by [d1exp_tr] in [ats_trans2_dyn1.dats]
   (instead of being done by [d2exp_tr] in [ats_trans3_dyn2.dats])
*)

3. The semantics for symbol overloading is greatly simplified.

4. Adding libc/sched based on /usr/include/sched.x

5. Adding libats/parworkshop to support multicore programming.

6. The examples in doc/EXAMPLE/MULTICORE are modified to run again.

7. Adding support for lliunt and ullint.

0.1.8

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.8:

As usual, this release contains many bug fixes.

Also, the following external package is added into ATS for supporting
programming with Xlib:

$ATSHOME/contrib/X11

Moreover, the following external packages in ATS have been significantly
extended:

$ATSHOME/contrib/GL
$ATSHOME/contrib/cairo
$ATSHOME/contrib/SDL
</pre>

######

0.1.7

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.7:

As usual, this release contains a large number of bug fixes. Also,
the following external packages have been made available for doing
graphics in ATS:

$ATSHOME/contrib/GL
$ATSHOME/contrib/cairo
$ATSHOME/contrib/SDL
</pre>

######

0.1.6

<pre>
ats-lang-aniriats-0.1.6:

As usual, this release contains a large number of bug fixes. Some of the
significant changes are listed as follows:

1. Support for OOP is under development. So far, typechecking is done.

2. Type error message reporting is made more informative. This is ongoing.

3. Adding $ATSHOME/ccomp/lib64 for storing libfiles for 64-bit machines.

4. The Makefile in $ATSHOME is re-designed by Likai Liu. It now allows
   ATS to be installed in a selected directory. Just issue the following
   command before calling 'make':

./configure --prefix=&lt;DESTDIR&gt;

   where &lt;DESTDIR&gt; is the directory for final installation. After 'make'
   is done, please call 'make install'.
