STATUS: Fixed on September 28, 2008 (HX)

Note that the handling of [continue] in a for-loop was incorrectly
conceived. After [continue], [post] section needs to be evaluated first
before jumping to the beginning of the loop. This means that some functions
in [ats_trans3_loop.dats] need to be modified appropriately.

Please find some typical uses of [for] loops inn the following file:

EXAMPLE/SHOOTOUT/SUBMIT/spectral-norm2.dats

STATUS: Fixed on September 26, 2008 (HX)

\begin{code}
val x = darray (); val y = darray (); val z = darray ()
macdef xyz (i, _1, _2, _3) = (
  x[,(i)] := ,(_1); y[,(i)] := ,(_2); z[,(i)] := ,(_3)
)
val () = xyz (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
\end{code}

\begin{errmsg}
error(macro): the variable [i] is unbound.
\end{errmsg}

The error was caused by the function [eval1_dexp] in [ats_macro2.dats]
not handling the case [D2Earrsub].

STATUS: Fixed on October 16, 2008 (HX)

The interaction between vbox and the effect [ref] is incorrect.

The case [P2Tvbox] in the function [p2at_tr_dn] is modified to take
into account the ref effect.

STATUS: Fixed on October 7, 2008 (HX)

A template tail call does not translate into a jump. This is a serious
bug!

\begin{code}
val A = loop<String> (argc, 0, A) where {
  fun{a:t@ype} loop {n,i:nat | i <= n}
    (n: int n, i: int i, A: farr (a, n-i)): farr (a, 0) = begin
    if i < n then begin
      loop (n, i+1, funarray_lorem A)
    end else A
  end // end of [loop]
} // end of [val]
\end{code}

The function [ccomp_tmpdef] in [ats_ccomp_trans_temp] did not push the
function lable into [the_tailcallst]. It is fixed now.

STATUS: Fixed on October 15, 2008 (HX)

A type variable of sort [type] may be instantiated with a type of sort
[t@ype]. This is a serious bug!!!

The function [s2exp_tyleq_solve_Var_r_err] in [ats_staexp2_solve.dats]
now does the needed subsort checking that should have been there.

STATUS: Fixed on November 3, 2008 (HX)

[withtype] annotations are not handled correctly. This was caused by
a glitch in the implementation of [d2exp_tr_dn]: the handling of the
case [D2Elam_dyn] was buggy.

fn f (i) = i + 1
withtype {i:nat} int i -> int (i+1)

val x = f (1)
