STATUS: Not yet fixed.

Note that the handling of [continue] in a for-loop was incorrectly
conceived. After [continue], [post] section needs to be evaluated first
before jumping to the beginning of the loop. This means that some functions
in [ats_trans3_loop.dats] need to be modified appropriately.

STATUS: Fixed on September 26, 2008

\begin{code}
val x = darray (); val y = darray (); val z = darray ()
macdef xyz (i, _1, _2, _3) = (
  x[,(i)] := ,(_1); y[,(i)] := ,(_2); z[,(i)] := ,(_3)
)
val () = xyz (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
\end{code}

\begin{errmsg}
error(macro): the variable [i] is unbound.
\end{errmsg}

The error was caused by the function [eval1_dexp] in [ats_macro2.dats]
not handling the case [D2Earrsub].
